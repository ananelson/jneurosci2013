abstract = {Clocks tick, bridges and skyscrapers vibrate, neuronal networks oscillate. Are neuronal oscillations an inevitable by-product, similar to bridge vibrations, or an essential part of the brain's design? Mammalian cortical neurons form behavior-dependent oscillating networks of various sizes, which span five orders of magnitude in frequency. These oscillations are phylogenetically preserved, suggesting that they are functionally relevant. Recent findings indicate that network oscillations bias input selection, temporally link neurons into assemblies, and facilitate synaptic plasticity, mechanisms that cooperatively support temporal representation and long-term consolidation of information.},

abstract = {1. Properties of dendritic glutamate receptor (GluR) channels were investigated using fast application of glutamate to outside-out membrane patches isolated from the apical dendrites of CA3 and CA1 pyramidal neurons in rat hippocampal slices. CA3 patches were formed (15-76 microns from the soma) in the region of mossy fibre (MF) synapses, and CA1 patches (25-174 microns from the soma) in the region of Schaffer collateral (SC) innervation. 2. Dual-component responses consisting of a rapidly rising and decaying component followed by a second, substantially slower, component were elicited by 1 ms pulses of 1 mM glutamate in the presence of 10 microM glycine and absence of external Mg2+. The fast component was selectively blocked by 2-5 microM 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) and the slow component by 30 microM D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (D-AP5), suggesting that the fast and slow components were mediated by the GluR channels of the L-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) and NMDA type, respectively. The peak amplitude ratio of the NMDA to AMPA receptor-mediated components varied between 0.03 and 0.62 in patches from both CA3 and CA1 dendrites. Patches lacking either component were rarely observed. 3. The peak current-voltage (I-V) relationship of the fast component was almost linear, whereas the I-V relationship of the slow component showed a region of negative slope in the presence of 1 mM external Mg2+. The reversal potential for both components was close to 0 mV. 4. Kainate-preferring GluR channels did not contribute appreciably to the response to glutamate. The responses to 100 ms pulses of 1 mM glutamate were mimicked by application of 1 mM AMPA, whereas 1 mM kainate produced much smaller, weakly desensitizing currents. This suggests that the fast component is primarily mediated by the action of glutamate on AMPA-preferring receptors. 5. The mean elementary conductance of AMPA receptor channels was about 10 pS, as estimated by non-stationary fluctuation analysis. The permeability of these channels to Ca2+ was low (approximately 5\% of the permeability to Cs+). 6. The elementary conductance of NMDA receptor channels was larger, with a main conductance state of about 45 pS. These channels were 3.6 times more permeable to Ca2+ than to Cs+.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Human anterior cingulate function has been explained primarily within a cognitive framework. We used functional MRI experiments with simultaneous electrocardiography to examine regional brain activity associated with autonomic cardiovascular control during performance of cognitive and motor tasks. Using indices of heart rate variability, and high- and low-frequency power in the cardiac rhythm, we observed activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) related to sympathetic modulation of heart rate that was dissociable from cognitive and motor-related activity. The findings predict that during effortful cognitive and motor behaviour the dorsal ACC supports the generation of associated autonomic states of cardiovascular arousal. We subsequently tested this prediction by studying three patients with focal damage involving the ACC while they performed effortful cognitive and motor tests. Each showed abnormalities in autonomic cardiovascular responses with blunted autonomic arousal to mental stress when compared with 147 normal subjects tested in identical fashion. Thus, converging neuroimaging and clinical findings suggest that ACC function mediates context-driven modulation of bodily arousal states.},

abstract = {Activations in human dorsomedial frontal and cingulate cortices are often present in neuroimaging studies of decision making and action selection. Interpretations have emphasized executive control, movement sequencing, error detection and conflict monitoring. Recently, however, experimental approaches, using lesions, inactivation, and cell recording, have suggested that these are just components of the areas' functions. Here we review these results and integrate them with those from neuroimaging. A medial superior frontal gyrus (SFG) region centred on the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) is involved in the selection of action sets whereas the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) has a fundamental role in relating actions to their consequences, both positive reinforcement outcomes and errors, and in guiding decisions about which actions are worth making.},

Replicating an earlier event-related potential (ERP) study, which showed an error feedback negativity that was modeled as having an ACC generator, we used event-related fMRI to investigate whether the ACC would differentiate between correct and incorrect feedback stimuli in a time estimation task. The design controlled for response conflict and frequency and expectancy effects. Although participants in the current study adjusted their performance following error feedback, we did not observe error feedback-evoked ACC activity. In contrast, we did observe ACC activity while the same subjects performed the Stroop task, in which an area of the ACC activated during both conflict and error trials. These findings are inconsistent with previous dipole models of the error feedback negativity, and suggest the ACC may not be involved in the generation of this ERP component. These results question involvement of the ACC in the detection of errors per se when controlling for conflict.},

abstract = {Activity in human dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) is correlated with errors, near-misses, and response conflict. Based on these observations, this region has been cast as playing a central role in models of error processing, conflict monitoring, and cognitive control. However, clear evidence that this region of the brain is necessary for these processes has been elusive. We studied the effects of damage to this region on four different error-related measures in five patients, and 19 healthy participants. Most error-related indices were not affected by such damage: patients had intact post-error slowing, and were able to report and to correct errors after they were made with accuracies comparable with the control group. However, all five patients were notably slow to correct errors, suggesting a deficit in on-line error prediction. This slowing was associated with impairment in the conscious prediction of error likelihood before a response. This finding constitutes important converging evidence for a critical role for human dACC in error monitoring, and sheds light on the selectivity and timing of the error-related process affected by dACC damage.},

The delay activity of many single neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of monkeys was found to be stimulus-specific, however, population dynamics of stimulus representation has not been elucidated. We analyzed the population state of a large number of PFC neurons during a somatosensory discrimination task. Using the tuning curves of the neurons, we derived a compact characterization of the population state. Stimulus representation by the population was found to degrade after stimulus termination, and emerge in a different form toward the end of the delay. Specifically, the tuning properties of neurons were found to change during the task. We suggest a mechanism whereby information about the stimulus is contained in activity-dependent synaptic facilitation of recurrent connections.},

abstract = {Dissociable effects of bilateral excitotoxic lesions of different regions of the rat neocortex, including medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices, were investigated in a five-choice serial reaction time task that provides several indices of the accuracy and speed of attentional function. Whereas medial prefrontal cortical lesions impaired performance of the task as revealed by a reduction in choice accuracy, an increase in the latency to respond correctly to the visual target and enhanced perseverative responding, lesions of the anterior cingulate cortex specifically increased premature responding. By contrast, lateral frontal cortical lesions did not significantly disrupt baseline performance of the task, but rather increased the latency to respond correctly to the visual target during various behavioral manipulations, for example, when the length of the intertrial interval was varied unpredictably and during interpolation of distracting bursts of white noise. Lesions of the parietal cortex failed to disrupt any aspect of task performance investigated. These behavioral effects in the five-choice task were compared with the effect of these same lesions on acquisition and retention of a one-trial passive avoidance task. The main finding from this paradigm was that lesions of the lateral frontal cortex produced a significant disruption to the retention of passive avoidance, which stands in marked contrast to the successful retention observed by animals of the other lesion groups. In addition, this pattern of results reveals that the 'disinhibitory' effect of cingulate cortex lesions are relatively specific to the five-choice attentional task. Finally, the results of the present study are compared with the findings of previous experiments using the five-choice task, which have examined the effect of selective manipulations of the ascending noradrenergic, cholinergic, dopaminergic, and serotonergic projections. In particular, the deficits in attentional function observed following cholinergic lesions of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis appear to be attributable to cholinergic denervation of the medial frontal cortex. These results are discussed in terms of the role of parallel distributed neural systems within the neocortex that mediate continuous attentional performance in the rat.},

When participants switch between tasks involving incongruent, congruent, and neutral stimuli, it is possible to examine both response conflict (incongruent vs. congruent) and task conflict (congruent vs. neutral). Here, we report an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study that examined which areas in frontal cortex, including MFC, are implicated in response conflict, task conflict, or both. Stimuli were incongruent and congruent arrow-word combinations, or arrows and words only in a neutral condition. Participants responded manually to the arrow or word. The task varied every second trial. The behavioral data revealed response conflict (incongruent>congruent) and task conflict (congruent>neutral) in mean reaction times and ex-Gaussian latency distribution components. The imaging data revealed activity in both the ACC and a more dorsal region in the MFC (the medial superior frontal gyrus) related to response conflict as well as task conflict. These conflict effects were observed independent of the task performed (arrow or word) or the trial type (repeat or switch). In lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), response conflict was associated with activity in ventral LPFC, whereas task conflict activated both ventral and dorsal regions. Thus, whereas the type of conflict (response vs. task) was differentiated in LPFC, no such differentiation was found in MFC, including the ACC. Models of ACC functioning may require modification to take account of these findings.},

To understand how different parts of the frontal cortex control the timing of action, we characterized the firing patterns of single neurons in two areas of rodent frontal cortex—dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and motor cortex—during a simple reaction time task. Principal component analysis was used to identify major patterns of delay-related activity in frontal cortex: ramping activity and sustained delay activity. These patterns were similar in dmPFC and motor cortex and did not change as animals learned to respond at novel delays. Many neurons in both areas were modulated early in the delay period. Other neurons were modulated in a persistent manner over the duration of the delay period. Delay-related modulations started earlier in motor cortex than in dmPFC and terminated around different task events (at the time of release in dmPFC, just before release of the lever in motor cortex). A subpopulation of neurons was found in dmPFC, but not motor cortex, that fired in response to the trigger stimulus. These results suggest that populations of neurons in rodent frontal cortex are coordinated during delay periods to enable proactive inhibitory control of action.},

abstract = {Previous studies have found no agreement on whether anticipatory activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) reflects upcoming conflict, error likelihood, or actual control adjustments. Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated the nature of preparatory activity in the ACC. Informative cues told the participants whether an upcoming target would or would not involve conflict in a Stroop-like task. Uninformative cues provided no such information. Behavioral responses were faster after informative than after uninformative cues, indicating cue-based adjustments in control. ACC activity was larger after informative than uninformative cues, as would be expected if the ACC is involved in anticipatory control. Importantly, this activation in the ACC was observed for informative cues even when the information conveyed by the cue was that the upcoming target evokes no response conflict and has low error likelihood. This finding demonstrates that the ACC is involved in anticipatory control processes independent of upcoming response conflict or error likelihood. Moreover, the response of the ACC to the target stimuli was critically dependent on whether the cue was informative or not. ACC activity differed among target conditions after uninformative cues only, indicating ACC involvement in actual control adjustments. Together, these findings argue strongly for a role of the ACC in anticipatory control independent of anticipated conflict and error likelihood, and also show that such control can eliminate conflict-related ACC activity during target processing. Models of frontal cortex conflict-detection and conflict-resolution mechanisms require modification to include consideration of these anticipatory control properties of the ACC.},

@article{Koyama2001,
abstract = {We recorded single neuronal activities in the anterior cingulate cortex of monkeys while they were performing discriminative pain-avoidance and reward tasks: a prediction cue was presented for 0.5-1.5 s, followed by a red or green discrimination cue (1:1, random) for 1.0 s; painful stimuli were presented if the monkey failed to respond during the red cue; a reward was given, subsequent to a cued 1 s delay, if the monkey responded after the green cue. Among 775 neurons recorded, 196 neurons showed significant activity during one or more observation periods; 36 during the prediction period; 77 during the discrimination period; 41 during the delay period; 85 during the response period; 40 during the pre-reward period; and 15 during the reward-ingestion period. Of 77 neurons activated during the discrimination period, 47 showed exclusive activity either during the red (34) or during the green (13) cue: of 85 neurons activated during the response period, 64 showed exclusive activity either for pain-avoidance (37) or obtaining a reward (27). Control experiments confirmed that the neuronal activity could not be attributed to simple visual or motor processes. The results suggest that some anterior cingulate neurons are involved with anticipation of, and response selection for, imminent events.},

@article{Singh2006,
abstract = {Measurements of neural activity in working memory during a somatosensory discrimination task show that the content of working memory is not only stimulus dependent but also strongly time varying. We present a biologically plausible neural model that reproduces the wide variety of characteristic responses observed in those experiments. Central to our model is a heterogeneous ensemble of two-dimensional neurons that are hypothesized to simultaneously encode two distinct stimuli dimensions. We demonstrate that the spiking activity of each neuron in the population can be understood as the result of a two-dimensional state space trajectory projected onto the tuning curve of the neuron. The wide variety of observed responses is thus a natural consequence of a population of neurons with a diverse set of preferred stimulus vectors and response functions in this two-dimensional space. In addition, we propose a taxonomy of network topologies that will generate the two-dimensional trajectory necessary to exploit this population. We conclude by proposing some experimental indicators to help distinguish among these possibilities.},

abstract = {One hypothesis concerning the human dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is that it functions, in part, to signal the occurrence of conflicts in information processing, thereby triggering compensatory adjustments in cognitive control. Since this idea was first proposed, a great deal of relevant empirical evidence has accrued. This evidence has largely corroborated the conflict-monitoring hypothesis, and some very recent work has provided striking new support for the theory. At the same time, other findings have posed specific challenges, especially concerning the way the theory addresses the processing of errors. Recent research has also begun to shed light on the larger function of the ACC, suggesting some new possibilities concerning how conflict monitoring might fit into the cingulate's overall role in cognition and action.},

@article{Mulert2003,
abstract = {Current concepts of cognitive control suggest that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is involved in performance monitoring. This idea is supported by the finding that increased ACC activity is found in situations in which errors are likely to occur, even if none are actually made. In addition, recent results suggest that increased ACC activity is negatively correlated with reaction time. We have now compared the error rates and the ACC activity of healthy subjects with short (n=19) vs. long reaction times (n=17) in an auditory choice reaction paradigm and analysed the current density differences in the ACC in the time range of the N1 component with low resolution electromagnetic tomography. Subjects with short reaction times showed significantly more ACC activation (Brodmann Area 24) and an increased error rate. This finding suggests that increased ACC activity is associated with a gain in reaction speed at the expense of correctness and is discussed in the context of current concepts about the role of the ACC in cognitive functions.},
